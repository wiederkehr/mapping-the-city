  <h1>Mapping the City</h1>
  <h2>Design strategies in the urban space.<h2>
  
  <p>Cities are places of exchange, where we find jobs, contacts, goods or inspiration. Cities make our global civilization work. they are its very core.</p>
  <p>Traditionally we map a city by tracing its streets and colouring in the footprint of its buildings, neatly separating the public from the private realm. But the space depicted by such a map is but an empty stage. the scene then is charged with potential generated by accessibility and infrastructure, and brought to life by the interaction of people.</p>
  <p>To understand this we need new kinds of maps focused on events, exchange and relationships, from the ‘derives’ of the situationists to the infographics of today. With the advent of mobile Internet and geo- referenced social media, it is finally possible to observe a spatial imprint of social interactions in real time. Cities which we normally only experi- ence as the sum of daily phenomena start to glow with data, engage us and let us interact as individuals in entirely new ways.</p>
  <p>Building on the understanding of urban systems and visual methods we developed in our office, our workshop will combine graphic mapping, with geo-referenced social media and film in an attempt to create a dynamic depiction of the city we live in, part map, part experience.</p>
